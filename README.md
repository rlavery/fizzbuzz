fizzbuzz
========

FizzBuzz can't prove that you're a competent programmer, but if you can't write FizzBuzz, you're not.

This is the first program in this version of my portfolio. It's a simple implementation of the "FizzBuzz"
program, which takes an integer as input from the user and returns a list of integers from 1 to the specified
limit. However, numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with 'Fizz', numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by 'Buzz',
and numbers divisible by 3 and 5 are replaced by 'FizzBuzz.'

If you have Ruby, you can run this program from the command line with this command:

$ ruby fizzBuzz.rb
